  "instructions": "Click the disallow/allow buttons above to see how the page loads with the policy on and off. When the policy is on, you won't see layout thrashing as large images load. Media without explicit sizes (either as HTML attributes ore defined in CSS) causes layout and text reflows as the page loads.",
