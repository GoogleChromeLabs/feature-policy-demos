    "what": "Allows developers to enforce that image/video elements have explicit dimensions. If dimensions aren't specified on the element, the browser sets a default size of 300x150 when this policy is active.",
    "why": "Reduces the layout work the browser has to perform.",
    "instructions": "Click the enable/disable buttons above to see how the page loads with the policy enabled/disabled. When the policy is enabled, you won't see layout thrashing as large images without sizes load and reflow text on the page.",
    "examples": {
      "header": "FeaturePolicy: unsized-media 'none'"
    }
