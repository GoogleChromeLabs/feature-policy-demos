    "what": "Allows developers to enforce that image/video elements have explicit dimensions. If dimensions aren't specified on the element, the browser sets a default size of 300x150 when this policy is active.",
    "why": "Reduces the layout work the browser has to perform.",
    "instructions": "Click the enable/disable buttons above to see how the page loads with the policy on and off. When the policy is on, you won't see layout thrashing as large images load. Media without explicit sizes (either as HTML attributes ore defined in CSS) causes layout and text reflows as the page loads",
